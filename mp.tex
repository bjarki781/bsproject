\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this paper we introduce a method that allows us to systematically find
    terminating systems, given an equivalence relation. This allows us to
    enumerate the equivalence classes the corresponding relation splits
    elements of $\Sym_n$. This in turn allows us to determine the Wilf-classes
    of some family of relations, in this paper all set partitions of $\Sym_3$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Hertzsprung patterns are permutation patterns in which both positions and values are
required to be adjacent.

Juxtaposition of permutations signifies catenation, so if $\pi=123$ and
$\tau=321$ then $\pi\tau=123654$.

\subsection{Equivalence, equivalence classes and motivation}
An equivalence relation is defined by a family of sets of permutations. We
consider all permutations in each set to be equivalent to each other. An
equivalence relation on $\Sym = \cup_{n \geq 1} \Sym_n$ splits each $\Sym_n$
into a set of equivalence classes.  We want to enumerate those classes.  Work
has been done on classical patterns and (other type linton)...  We will focus
exclusively on equivalence relations of Hertzsprung patterns. 

\begin{example}
    If we say $123 \equiv 321, 231 \equiv 312$ then we consider the permutations
    $1234, 3214$ and $1432$ equivalent, and $1342$ and $1423$ equivalent.
\end{example}

The equivalence relation splits $\Sym$ into equivalence classes. We want to
enumerate those classes.

To do this we will introduce pattern-rewriting systems.

\subsection{Pattern-rewriting systems}
A pattern-rewriting system is a subset $R \subset \cup_n \Sym_n \times \Sym_n$. 
This subset induces a relation on $\Sym$ in the following way: We say
permutations $p, q \in \Sym_k$ relate if there exists $(\alpha,\beta) \in R$ so 
we can write $p = \sigma \alpha \tau$ and $q = \sigma \beta \tau$, where
$\sigma$ and $\tau$ are some permutations.
Note that the relation is length-preserving.
For example, if $R = {123 \to 321}$, then $1234$ relates to $3214$.
The domain of $R$ we denote by $\dom(R) = {\alpha : (\alpha, \beta) \in R}$.
The image of $R$ we in turn denote $\img(R) = {\beta : (\alpha, \beta) \in R}$.
We denote the reflexive transitive closure of $R$ as $\tostar$, that
is, any number of applications of $R$.

An element $x$ in $\Sym$ is said to be in normal form under system $R$ if there
is no $y \in \Sym$ so that $x \to_R y$. The relation induced by the system is
said to be terminating if there exist no infinite chains $x_0 \to x_1 \to
\cdots$. If $\to$ is terminating then every element has a normal form. 

A relation is confluent if and only if
$$
    y_1 \fromstar x \tostar y_2 \Longrightarrow 
    \exists z. \  y_1 \tostar z \fromstar y_2
$$.

If a system is both terminating and confluent, then every element has a one and
only one normal form.

\begin{corollary}
    If $R$ is a terminating and confluent pattern-rewriting system, then the set
    of $\dom(R)$-avoiding permutations in $S_n$ is a complete set of
    representives for $S_n / \equiv$, the set of equivalence classes of
    $\equiv$.
\end{corollary}

So the problem is reduced to generating a terminating and confluent system $R$
given a sets of equivalent partitions then enumerating $\dom(R)$-avoiding permutations.
Section 2 of Claesson's paper provides us with a way to do that. \cite{claesson}

We begin with finding systems that terminate, and which we then make confluent.
These terminating systems are composed of single-image systems that each are
created from a respective equivalence relation.

\begin{definition}
    Let the statistic $\sum_\tau$ be the sum of the positions of occurences of
    the pattern $\tau$. We can use this as an increasing statistic.
    \cite{claesson}.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Increasing statistics}
A statistic is any function $f : \Sym \to \mathbb{N}$. We call $f$ an increasing
statistic on $R$ if $\pi \to \sigma$ implies that $f(\pi) < f(\sigma)$ for all
$\pi \to \sigma \in R$.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $R$ be a pattern-rewriting system. If there exists an increasing
    statistic with respect to $R$, then $\to$ is terminating.    
\end{lemma}

Let's take one example from Claesson's paper.
\begin{example}
    Let's look at the equivalence $12 \equiv 21$. We can choose the system 
    $\{ 21 \to 12 \}$. This is terminating since the statistic $\sum_{12}$ is
    increasing for that system. It's not confluent though, since $321 \to 231$
    and $321 \to 312$. So we add the rule $231 \to 312$ to the system and we
    have a confluent system by Lemma 3.3 in Claesson's paper. 

    By his machinery we find that $\sum_{n \geq 1} \Sym_n(21) = \sum_{m \geq 0}
    m!(x-x^2)^m$ which is the joint distribution of the equivalence classes
    defined by $12 \equiv 21$.
\end{example}

\section{Finding terminating systems systematically}
In Claesson's paper, he only found systems corresponding to equivalence
relations induced by a single set of patterns. We will introduce a method for
finding systems for equivalence relations induced by any number of sets.

Let's begin focussing on \emph{single-image systems}. That is, systems, which
have only a single pattern as their image. Claesson only looked at these kinds
of systems. A single-image system corresponds to a set of patterns which we
consider equivalent. We then catenate a family the single-image systems to
create a system that correponds to a respective family of equivalences.

\begin{example}
    The equivalence $123 \equiv 321$ allows two single-image systems, namely $\{123 \to
    321\}$ and $\{321 \to 123\}$. The same goes for $132 \equiv 312$, $\{132 \to
    312\}$ and $\{312 \to 132\}$.

    Then the relation $\{123 \equiv 321, 132 \equiv 312\}$ can then generate
    four possible systems: $\{123 \to 321, 132 \to 312\}$, $\{123 \to 321, 312
    \to 132\}$, etc.
\end{example}

\todo{
Let's explain why catenating single-image systems works
}

Let us introduce a method for determining the termination of a system.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $E$ be a single-image system. If $\pi \to \rho$ is in $E$ and 
    \[
        \sum\nolimits_\rho(u\pi v) < \sum\nolimits_\rho(u \rho v) \tag{$\ast$}
        \label{increasingimage}
    \]
    then $\sum$ parameterized by the image of $E$ is an increasing statistic on
    $E$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    If $\pi \to \rho$ is in $E$ then we see $\sum_\rho(\pi) <
    \sum_\rho(\rho)$.  We see that each application of a rule of the system
    will only make the resulting permutation have a higher sigma value.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $E$ be a single-image system with $\{\rho\} = \img(E)$. If
    \[
        \pi_i[-l_i, 0] = \rho[-l_i, 0] \quad \textnormal{where} \quad l_i :=
        \len(\shr(\pi_i, \rho)) \tag{$\ast\ast$} \label{joininvariance}
    \]
    for each $\pi_i \to \rho \in E$ then $E$ fulfills condition
    \eqref{increasingimage}. The notation treats the permutations as lists in
    python with the same slicing behaviour. Here $\shr(\alpha, \beta)$ signifies the part
    where, if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ form a cluster, they share. $\shr(132, 213) =
    32$. We assume that they just have one cluster, since we're not clustering
    the same pattern, 123 and 123, for example. $\len$ is just the length of
    a pattern.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let us assume that we have a rule in $E$, namely $\pi \to \rho$ and so
    $0 = \sum_\rho(\pi) < \sum_\rho(\rho) = 1$. Then $u \pi v \to u \rho v$. 
    If $\rho$ is fully contained in either $u$ or $v$ then $\to$ won't have any
    implication for those occurences. If $\rho$ appears in $u\pi$ then
    application of the rule will move it further to the right, increasing the
    value of sigma. If $\rho$ appears in $\pi v$ then we assume it's static for
    that part so we will have two occurences of $\rho$, one where $\pi$ was and
    then we did not alter other one.
    We can see that every application of rules from $R$ will increase.
\end{proof}

So by taking applying two lemmas together we have that if a single-image system
fulfills \eqref{joininvariance} then sigma parameterized by the image of $E$ is
an increasing statistic. Hence $E$ is terminating.

\begin{definition}
    A sigma statistic parameterized by a set of patterns is simply defined as
    $$
        \sum\nolimits_{\{\tau_0, ..., \tau_n\}}(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum\nolimits_{\tau_i}(x).
    $$.
    We see this is an increasing statistic for a concatenation of systems if
    each system has an increasing $\sum_{\tau_i}$.  Each rule application will
    increase one statistic, and then the whole sum of the statistics.
\end{definition}

With this new definiton we can work with equivalence relations that contain more than one
equivalence.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $R$ be a system composed of the single-image systems $E_i$ which fulfill
    condition \eqref{joininvariance}. We say $\{\rho_i\} = \img(E_i)$. Then $\sum\nolimits_{\rho_i}$ 
    is an increasing statistic for each $E_i$ and then by summing these
    statistics together we have an increasing statistic for $R$.
    The system $R$ is hence terminating.
\end{theorem}

This theorem works well but it does not work for every possible equivalence relation.
Take the equivalence $213 \equiv 132$ for example, none of its single-image systems fulfill
\eqref{joininvariance} and when we apply some symmetries to it, we get $312
\equiv 231$ which has the same problem.

But for $213 \equiv 132$ sigma parameterized by a smaller statistic, namely $21$, is an
increasing statistic so $\{ 213 \to 132 \}$ is a terminating system.

With these observation we are able to find terminating systems for all set
partitions on $\Sym_3$.

\todo{this definition is just me spitballing}
\begin{definition}
    So an appearence of one image will increase the statistic more then the
    appearence of another type of image.

    Each application of the system will increase the statistic somewhat.

    If some image can cluster after permutations in domains then we let that
    image have more priority than the other images. (is there a system where two
    images cluster before each other???

    Does it solve the problem of 231=312?
\end{definition}

\section{Making a terminating system confluent}
First we can reduce the amount we check by the symmetries of the square.
If we show that a system is both terminating and confluent, then all systems
which we can arrive at through mirroring the permutations etc are also
terminating and confluent.

I have not found one algorithm that can make all systems confluent.
I'm using two.

With a system that is terminating, then it's possible to preserve its
termination when making it confluent.
By ensuring that all rules that are added have a positive sigma difference
we can be certain that a system is still confluent. 


\section{Application, result and verification}
There are 10 different combinatorial classes.
\subsection{Programming}
There were three small programs written for the project: mp for generating the
systems from the equivalence relations, mp2 for taking the domain of these
systems and calculating the generating functions and finding if their sequences
were found in the OEIS, and finally tester which calculates the first 6 values
of the sequences manually. mp and tester were written in Haskell and mp2 in SageMath. 


\section{Problems, questions, remarks}
Are there larger systems, for example from $\Sym_4$, where we cannot apply the
methods used in this paper?
